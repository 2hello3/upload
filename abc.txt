Tonkin (Vietnam) was not renowned as a principal market for European companies but served as a supplementary place and intermediary in their East Asian trading networks during the seventeenth century. With its local products such as silk which could serve intra-Asian demand and its geography which meant that it lay on the route between the south and mainland China, both Tonkin attracted foreign merchants to trade there during this time1.

• There was extensive trade between Tonkin and southern China during this period, especially the export of commercial crops from Tonkin to China such as pepper, cinnamon, lacquer, and textiles. Tonkin was seen as a "granary" for rice and a source of luxury goods for Guangdong province in China.

• The trade was regulated through a system of 11 border markets on the China-Tonkin border. Chinese merchants would import silk, tea, porcelain, and metals into these markets to exchange for Tonkinese goods. Many Chinese migrants also settled in Tonkin during this time.

• The trade was very profitable and important for the economy of both China and Tonkin. It generated revenues for the Nguyen lords who ruled Tonkin and supported their wars. For China, the goods from Tonkin catered to the rising demand for luxuries from its growing middle class.

• The maritime trade also flourished during this period. Chinese junks would sail directly to ports in Tonkin like Haiphong to acquire goods. Tonkinese merchants also actively traded in Guangdong's ports. This led to cultural and economic exchange along the maritime route.

• Conflicts between China and Tonkin disrupted trade at times. But rulers on both sides usually tried to limit the scope of wars to maintain the commercial ties. The trade gradually declined starting in the 19th century due to political turmoil and rise of Western imperialism in Vietnam.

According to the provided text file, the trade between Tonkin (Northern Vietnam) and China in the 17th and 18th centuries was largely controlled by Chinese merchants. These merchants would travel to Tonkin with goods such as silk, porcelain, and tea, which they would exchange for raw materials such as rice, cotton, and buffalo hides. The trade was conducted through a system of guilds, which were organized by the Chinese merchants and controlled the pricing and distribution of goods. Despite this dominance, Tonkin was able to maintain some degree of autonomy in its trade with China, as evidenced by the fact that Vietnamese officials were able to negotiate favorable trade agreements with the Chinese government. Overall, the trade between Tonkin and China was a significant part of the economic and cultural exchange between the two countries during this period.

During the 17th and 18th centuries, Tonkin was a part of the Kingdom of Dai Viet, which was ruled by the Le Dynasty. The Le rulers sought to maintain good relations with China, as China was a powerful neighbor and a major trading partner. The Chinese merchants who controlled the trade with Tonkin were known as the "fan" or "barbarian" merchants, as they were not subject to Chinese law and were viewed as outsiders by the Chinese government.

Despite this status, the fan merchants were able to wield significant power in Tonkin through their control of the guilds. These guilds were organized by the fan merchants and regulated the prices and distribution of goods in Tonkin. The guilds also had the power to punish Vietnamese merchants who violated their rules.

Despite the dominance of the fan merchants, the Vietnamese government was able to negotiate favorable trade agreements with the Chinese government. For example, in 1717, the Vietnamese king appointed a special envoy to Beijing to negotiate a new trade agreement with the Qing dynasty. The resulting agreement allowed Vietnamese merchants to trade directly with China, rather than having to go through the fan merchants.

Overall, the trade between Tonkin and China during the 17th and 18th centuries was an important part of the economic and cultural exchange between the two countries. While the fan merchants held significant power in Tonkin, the Vietnamese government was able to maintain some degree of autonomy in its trade relations with China.

    Một trong những đối tác giao thương lớn ở Đàng Ngoài là Nhật Bản. 30 năm đầu tiên của thế kỷ 16 là thời kỳ mà quan hệ thượng mại giữa 2 bên phát triển thịnh vượng. Lượng lớn tơ lụa được vận chuyển để đổi lấy bạc từ Việt Nam đến Nhật Bản, do không thể nhập từ Trung Quốc trong bối cảnh đất nước này đang áp dụng biện pháp cấm cửa. Ngoài ra, chúa Trịnh trực tiếp quản lý việc nhập các mặt hàng như vũ khí, kim loại và thuốc súng, phục vụ cho chiến tranh với Đàng Trong. Hầu hết các chuyến tàu là vào tháng 11 đến tháng 4 năm sau, còn gọi là "Mùa mậu dịch" vì đây là khoảng thời gian nước sông thuận lợi cho tàu thuyền ra vào.
    Vào khoảng năm 1630, quan hệ thương mại giữa Đàng Ngoài và Nhật Bản bị suy yếu khi Mạc chủ Nhật Bản không hài lòng với thái độ của Chúa Trịnh và có thiên hướng về Đàng Trong. Đây là lúc Bồ Đào Nha nhảy vào và lên kế hoạch làm người vận chuyển hàng hoá giữa Đàng Ngoài và Nhật Bản. Tuy vậy, họ đã thất bại khi đến năm 1639, Bồ Đào Nha không được phép đặt chân vào Nhật Bản do lệnh Toả quốc.
    Giao thương giữa Đàng Ngoài và Nhật Bản không chấm dứt ở đó mà được tiếp tục thông qua các thương nhân người Hoa và Hà Lan tới tận thế kỷ 18.

Điều khác biệt so với Đàng Trong là ở Đàng Ngoài không hình thành các phố Nhật, do chính quyền Lê - Trịnh lo sợ sự xâm nhập của các thương nhân ngoại quốc.
